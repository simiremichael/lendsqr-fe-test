# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) TS template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

Run 'npm install' to install all dependencies
Thereafter  'npm start'

This project is built with React, typescript, react-router and Rtk query for state managment.

Material ui and Emotion is used for styling.

i prefer styling this way, each components with it styling. it makes it very easy to find bugs.
